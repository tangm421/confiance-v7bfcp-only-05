=====
NOTES
=====

This package contains all the needed files to build
a BFCP-enabled application:

	- BFCP_library, which contains the behaviour
	  libraries for both the client and server
	  sides;
	- BFCP_messages_processing, which only contains
	  the libraries to build and parse BFCP messages
	  (already included in the BFCP_library behaviour
	  too, only use if you want to implement a BFCP
	  behaviour of your own).

Both the libraries come with attached test applications to
show their use.

A Win32 version of the libraries has been made available too.
